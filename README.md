# DA1301Lab
GitHub repository for DA1301 IITM

## Brief Intro
$ whoami  
My name is Prahlad Shrinivas, CEM25. I am from Bengaluru, Karnataka. I love coding, playing TT, and listening to music.  

$ man git  
I've been using GitHub for some time now, but this is the first time i've created an account. It's a great place to collaborate, learn from code, sometimes clone repos (maybe steal code ðŸ™ƒ) .  
I have found some really good and useful projects on GitHub which have made my life soooo much easier.  

$ find Python/ -name solution.py | grep favourite  
My favourite problem wasn't actaully one that was given as an assignment, but one that was mentioned in class - The 8 Queens Problem. Though if i had to pick a favourite from the ones given, it'll probably be the morse code one.
